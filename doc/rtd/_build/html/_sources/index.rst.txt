MLPro-Int-River - Integration of River into MLPro
=================================================

Welcome to MLPro-Int-River, an extension to MLPro to integrate the River package.
MLPro is a middleware framework for standardized machine learning in Python. It is 
developed by the South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences, Germany, and provides 
standards, templates, and processes for hybrid machine learning applications. River, in 
turn, provides numerous state-of-the-art algorithms for several topics of online machine 
learning.

MLPro-Int-River provides wrapper classes that allow the use of selected River functionality 
in your MLPro applications. The use of these wrappers is illustrated in numerous example programs.
